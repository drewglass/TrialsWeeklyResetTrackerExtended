## Original Author

## Special Thanks
- [BrightOblivion](http://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?userid=33721) for spotting the Halls of Fabrication timer bug (fixed in 1.5.1)
- [seganku](http://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?userid=29192) for providing informations for the new Cloudrest trial (added in 1.7.0)

## How It Works
Each timer starts after the first time you complete a trial quest and received the corresponding loot per character.

## Commands
### /twrte
Display trial timers for all your characters.

### /twrtedebug
Toggle debug mode. When in debug mode, all looted items and completed quests will be logged in chat with their ID.
